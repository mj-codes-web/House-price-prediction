# House-price-prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

Accurate house price estimation is important for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. This project focuses on predicting **house prices based on key property features** using **machine learning regression techniques**.

The model learns patterns from historical housing data to estimate property prices, demonstrating the application of ML in real-world decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To analyze and preprocess housing data
* To identify important features affecting house prices
* To build and evaluate regression models for price prediction
* To compare model performance using appropriate metrics

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Manual estimation of house prices can be subjective and inconsistent. This project aims to develop a **data-driven machine learning solution** that predicts house prices more accurately using historical data and property characteristics.
